I am a bioinformatician and PhD researcher at Center for Inflammation Research of the Flemish Institute of Biotechnology and Ghent University in Ghent, Belgium.
I am currently working on my PhD, having secured an FWO Strategic Basic research fellowship.

My interests are machine learning and (including) deep learning applied in biomedical contexts.
My favourite biological data are high-dimensional single-cell datasets.
