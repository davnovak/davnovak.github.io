I am a bioinformatician and PhD researcher at [Saeys lab](https://saeyslab.sites.vib.be/en), [Center for Inflammation Research](https://www.irc.ugent.be) of the Flemish Institute of Biotechnology and Ghent University in Ghent, Belgium.
I am currently working on my PhD, having secured an [FWO Strategic Basic research](https://www.fwo.be/en/fellowships-funding/phd-fellowships/phd-fellowship-strategic-basic-research/) fellowship.

My interests include machine learning and (including) deep learning applied in biomedical contexts.
My favourite biological data is single-cell.

Check out my full [CV](cv.pdf) for more about my work experience and education.
See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FU7FJPcAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for publication activity.

Some of my publicly available project repositories, including collaborations, are listed below.

### [**tviblindi**](https://github.com/stuchly/tviblindi)

*tviblindi* is a semi-supervised trajectory inference tool for single-cell data that uses topological data analysis (TDA) and persistent homology to be able to work will the full, high-dimensional data, mitigating loss of information due to dimensionality reduction.
For my master thesis, I implemented parts of the TDA pipeline in C++ and created a method for clustering trajectories based on persistent homology, as well a GUI for semi-supervised analyses using that clustering, in R & Shiny.
